h1. Prefetch-Test::Unit

Prefetch-Test::Unit shortens start-up time of Rails unit test using Test::Unit.

h2. Usage

Execute ptestunit.rb in your Rails app root directory.

Start server first.

<pre>
<code>
$ ruby ptestunit.rb server
</code>
</pre>

Execute your tests.

<pre>
<code>
$ ruby ptestunit.rb run test/unit/**/*.rb
</code>
</pre>

There are no way to stop your server process. Use 'killall ruby' command to stop it.

h2. How it works

The 'server' process start sub-process as "ruby ptestunit.rb test".

The 'test' process loads your Rails app and wait.

The 'run' process connect to 'test' process using socket, and sends test files to it.

The 'test' process executes the test and exit. And the 'server' process start 'test' process again.
